## Description
Represents a tool that generates the elliptic curve parameters in finite fields for cryptographic use.<br/>
This implementation favors strong elliptic curve parameter generation in finite fields, based on modified<br/> SEA algorithm.<br/>
## Required Steps
✅ First build [Eduard](https://github.com/MateiIonutEduard/Eduard) cryptographic library<br/>
✅ Select library file  from location where was built, <br/>now you're ready to run.<br/>
